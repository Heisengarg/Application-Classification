**Project Summary**

In this project we identify home appliances using the voltage and current data obtained from different smart meters. A public dataset of high resolution for load identification research called PLAID  is used for the analysis. The PLAID dataset comprises of current vs voltage profile for the 1074 appliances (of 11 types) for a duration of about 5 seconds.    Different multi-class classifiers are trained and tested on the dataset in order to identify the most accurate and computationally inexpensive model. An image classification approach of Voltage-Current profiles in steady state is used to model the inputs of the appliance classifiers. Based on the analysis undertaken the 11 unique appliances are identified using multiple classifiers while their performance is compared in terms of time and accuracy.   An accuracy of more than 92% was achieved towards the end.
